Totally hopeless service from you, your delivery agent n from ur telestaff. All r inefficient n for company they r good as they saved ur money bt if customer nt satisfied then they left u n your product then this cost is also too much for u. Keep in mind that also.

@chicagosmayor My nephew has asked me to reach out and contact  mayor on the complete failure of UKG TeleStaff which schedules manning for the Fire Dept. Apparently,Holt was unable to foresee a ransom attack which disabled the program on the cloud. Leadership FAIL!
Worst types of people: 1) real estate agents, 2) used bookstore cashiers (just cause you work in a bookstore don't mean you read all the books a-hole), 3) Starbucks store managers (Stop hiding in the back and brew me some joe), 4) phonebank telestaff, 5) Elon Musks.
I CANT  ACCESS TELESTAFF....BUT ANYWAY HES OFF AGAIN https://t.co/VPrtuUufIW

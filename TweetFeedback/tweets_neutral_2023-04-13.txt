@Bungie So is bungie also issuing a "fix" for their TELESTaff? I think they all may be on the fritz as well. ðŸ˜† ðŸ¤£

@bethadams53 Definitely overall increase in volume, but most calls werenâ€™t holding for fire units, whereas some of these medic unit distances. Like M301 running to 409s areaâ€¦100% agree, fairfax isnâ€™t the only one affected with staff shortages due to Covid and lack of Telestaff compounding it
@zdubya11 We use Firehouse (the old version. Not the web based one) for scheduling.  But we clock in/out using Kronos (not Telestaff, the regular Kronos).  Hours are tracked in FH, Kronos, and Sharepoint. Everything must match.
We sign up for vacation in Sharepoint and FH.
